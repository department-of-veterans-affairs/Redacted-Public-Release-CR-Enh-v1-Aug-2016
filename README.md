Repository containing the CIF submission for Converged Registries Solution Enhancements v1 rec Aug 2016.
The Converged Registries platform is a hardware and software architecture designed to host individual patient registries and eliminate duplicative development effort while maximizing VAâ€™s ability to create new patient registries. The common platform includes a relational database, software classes, security modules, extraction services and other components. The Converged Registries obtains data from the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), directly from the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) as well as by direct user input. Central tools are relatively easy to customize for each registry in support of data entry, analysis, and reporting.
